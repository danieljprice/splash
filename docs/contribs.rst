============

Please contribute! All user contributions or suggestions are greatly
appreciated. In particular, please send:

-  Bugs! (best way is to `file an issue <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash/issues>`_)

-  `Feature requests/suggestions <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash/issues>`_

-  Pretty pictures for `the gallery <http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/splash/gallery/index.html>`_.

If you are \*really\* keen, you may also like to consider:

-  Exact solution routines for test problem(s). Even just an analytic
   description from which I can write the code.

-  Suggestions/tips on possible visualisation techniques

-  More colour schemes (simply email me a table of the rgb colour
   indices, or failing that simply an image of the colour scheme and I
   will add it).

For discussion, feel free to `raise an issue on the tracker <https://github.com/danieljprice/splash/issues>`_.

Otherwise, you can send an email to the `mailing list <mailto:splash-users@googlegroups.com>`_ or `get in touch directly <mailto:daniel.price@monash.edu>`_.

Acknowledgements
================

Josh Calcino contributed significantly to development of the unified 
splash binary used in version 3. James Wetter led original development
of the giza backend used in version 2 onwards. The exact rendering
algorithm was contributed by Maya Petkova, based on [Petkova18]_.
Several of the routines were developed from ideas used by Matthew Bate
and splash has been refined by many useful discussions with Matthew. The
polytrope exact solution is from a routine by Joe Monaghan. I am
indebted to one Thomas S. Ullrich at the University of Heidelberg who
wrote the prompting module which is used throughout the program and to
Roland Schmehl who wrote the excellent function parser module (made
available at http://fparser.sourceforge.net). Last but not least, a huge
thanks especially to all the users who have given feedback which has
helped to improve splash including, but not limited to:
